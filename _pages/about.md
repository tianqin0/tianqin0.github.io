Hi, I am a second-year master student at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn), advised by Prof. [Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html) and Prof. [Fengxiang He](https://fengxianghe.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Probability and Statistics from USTC in 2022. Here is my [curriculum vitae](https://www.overleaf.com/read/drckcvgkgnsr).

Research Interest
=====
I have an interest in statistics, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and game theory. Most recently, I focus on the theoretical study of *equivariance*, a specific way to incorporate inductive bias in deep learning. Feel free to contact me for anything.

Publication
=====
- Benefits of Permutation-Equivariance in Auction Mechanisms \
  In *Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2022* \
  **Tian Qin**, Fengxiang He, Dingfeng Shi, Wenbing Huang, Dacheng Tao \
  **TL;DR**: Permutation-equivariance decreases the ex-post regret and improves the generalization while maintaining the revenue. \
